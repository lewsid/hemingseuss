Introduction
============

Dinkly was built from the ground up to be simple, flexible, but most importantly - easy to understand. You won't find any bloat here. What you will find is a clean little MVC framework that gives you only what you need to get your application up and running, and nothing you don't.

Dinkly is minimal on a whole new level. It is also very extensible, with full support for Composer, as well as a fully extensible core.
